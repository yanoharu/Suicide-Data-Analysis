# Suicide Data Analysis Project

 This is a data analysis project in Macro Data Science class when I was a junior. In this project, I explore correlation between fluctuation in suicide and media report on suicide using data in Japan. There's been phenomena that we find increase in suicide after media reports suicide of celebrity. This is called <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A7%E3%83%AB%E3%83%86%E3%83%AB%E5%8A%B9%E6%9E%9C">"Werther effect"</a> or "Copycat suicide". Especially, during covid-19 pandemic, we saw increase in suicide and some of them were reported by media. If we actually can observe the phenomenon, then policy maker and mass media have to take some measure to prevent news report from inducing suicide. My purpose here is to make it clear that whether we can find "Werther effect". If you are not familier with time series data analysis, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405918817300405">this paper</a> helps you understand time series analysis briefly.
